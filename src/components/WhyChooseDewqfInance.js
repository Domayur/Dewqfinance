                                Founders and creators are often caught off guard not knowing how to keep track of the
                                data sets that their business is providing them. Which metrics are key performance
                                indicators, and what is the data your bookkeepers are creating telling you? </p>

                                so much more is standard here. We have a strong background in general business and can
                                also assist with other day to day tasks. Hiring contractors or employees with financial
                                terms, NDAs, getting a Statement of Work in place, optimizing marketing cost efficiency,

                                and gathering the needed records of your company to tell a full story of what is
