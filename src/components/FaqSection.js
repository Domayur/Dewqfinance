                                                With consultants the answer will vary depending on what you are looking for.
                                                However, we like to be very transparent and want to generally let you know
                                                what to expect. Our current average client is about $5,000 per month. We run
                                                on a fixed price per month retainer model. After you schedule your first
                                                free consultation with us, we will walk through the areas you have covered
                                                and those areas that you donâ€™t. Once we have a better idea of where we will
                                                integrate to free up your time, we will get you a fixed monthly bid with
                                                options on contract length. (Our minimum contract length is 2 months)

                                                We can work with just about any business! In our initial consultation we can
                                                discuss this further if needed. Past experience has taken us down many
                                                different industries. Lately, we have gone really deep into businesses
                                                dealing in crypto. We also have retail, subscription, service, food service,
                                                recruiting/bounty, and hospitality experience. Sit down for a chat, and we
                                                will show you how it will work.
